## Roadmap
Player
- Sword swing animation
- Bow animation
- Dash / roll animation(s)
- Sprinting

Frog
- Figure out why it's sliding into trees
- Figure out to spawn these guys in dynamically around the player. Look into persistent enemies. That is when a player sees a frog in a chunk but then goes away from that frog, that frog will be deleted, but it will still exist in memory when the player comes back to that chunk.

Terrain
- Redo world generation to work with meshes
